## Introduction

Our Journal is a project made by [Ian Mandap](https://github.com/theIanMilan) and [Janson Siy](https://github.com/JansonSiy) that allows users to sign up and create categories to keep track of tasks that they want to accomplish. It displays the user's task completion progress per category level. 

The goal in building this app was to learn about Test Driven Development (TDD) and one-to-many association between models.
